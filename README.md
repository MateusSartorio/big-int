# bit_int
A simple big int library made in c++.

To compile and run the program, you need to have gcc installed on your machine (or other c++ compiler, but the steps described below won't work), and give the file "run" (present in the root directory) permission to run. On unix based systems this can be done in the terminal with the command "chmod +x run".
The software is completely free and can be used however you see fit, with no need to contact me beforehand.
